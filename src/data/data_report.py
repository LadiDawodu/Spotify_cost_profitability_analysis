# What is the distribution of costs across different 
# categories such as sales and marketing, research and development, 
# and general administrative costs? 
# How have these costs changed over time, 
# and what impact do they have on overall profitability?



# The business landscape is rather competitive in today's market
# it's paramount to orginizational success. Cost analysis offers
# a foundational pillar in the descision-making process, which in turn
#Â provides invaluable insight into operational effeciency, resource allocation,
# and overall financial literacy.
# Checking cost structures over time we can get a better view of potential inefficiencies,
# and maximise profitability
# The objectives of this 'Cost Analysis' is to understand the relationship
# between cost dynamics / overall profits, which should help in the understandings
# of the fluctuations in costs. Also to show cost expenditure that can be furhter optimized
# By understanding costs there can be financial organization which as stated in the beginning
# is needed for today's competitve landscapce
